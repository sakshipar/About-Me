			The best thing that happened to me during my time quarantining is that surprisingly I became more social than I used to be&#46; <br> To kill everyone's bordem my friend created group chat with everyone who she played ludo with&#46; <br>Initially&#44; this group chat wasa only supposed to be to send ludo codes but as time passed by&#44; this group became the most active one I had ever been in&#46; <br>I found two new friends through this group who I became very close to in very little time&#46;
